# TalonMaster Storm
Very rough guide on how I  made my TalonMaster. Not that I recommend trying it, as it uses lots of bits from lots of kits. According to the datasheet the model should have a twin heavy bolter (THB) and twin assualt cannon (TAC) (2 heavy bolters, 2 assault cannons), my rendition has neither of these, instead proxying a hurricane bolter and avenger mega bolter (AMB), because i prefer then aesthetically, and I don't play in proper tournaments . I'll list these parts as optional if you'd rather run *WYSIWYG*.

## How to
### Prep
Standard fair, cut your parts off the sprue, clean up with sandpaper & knife. I'd recommend going over the whole instructions first, and also the instructions for both landspeeder storm & dark talon.
### The body
Assemble storm as per step 1 of included instructions - attach seats to bottom plate. That is all.
-	Its probably worth sanding the back of the seats flat at this point, its got shotguns & things molded onto it that will just get in the way later.

### The nose
So the idea here was to have the nose gun's mounted inside the chassis rather than underslung. I used part 31 - the roof from the Nephilim here in order to raise the nose up a bit and fit the gun inside.
- carefully cut the raised bit of the Nephlim roof part away from the rest of the roof.
- sand off the iconography from the roof section, as it will be upside down when we attach it
- position it in the centre of the hood of the landspeeder, sand it till its a good fit, then glue it down
- cut away the hood of the speeder that is now underneath the new raised section
- At this point you need to decide what you want in the nose, THB, TAC, or AMB. All will fit, but require different amounts of the front of the bottom plate of the speeder to be cut away (under where the new raised nose sits. The THB you can get away without cutting any away, and the AMB needs the whole area to be removed.
- Attach your chosen weapon inside the vehicle, glued to the bottom plate, shape some plasticard to match the profile of the hood as a backing to the weapon(probably only really necessary with the AMB).
- You can now attach the grav plates to the front of the speeder, although you will need to remove the centre plate, as you now have guns there. I'm sure this won't impact performance whatsoever...
- Now you can attach the rest of the gubbins to the front as per the storm instructions - lights, passenger rail thing, pilot blast shield, little front baby wings, weird probe thing.
	- Of note on the weird probe thing, the one on the storm has a single probe. I used the probe  from the ravenwing upgrade kit which is like a fork(?). To do this cut the probe poll off of the attachment bit on both parts, and swap the pole, using the fork probe from the ravenwing kit, on the base piece from the storm. You have to do it like this as the ravenwing probe doesn't fit the storm chassis.
- Leave the hood & crew compartment unattached for now, as it makes the next bit easier.

### The stasis crypt base
This was by far the thing I spent longest on, and was the most difficult. The idea here is to change the middle section of the storm from scout storage/party lounge to Fallen transportation device.
- To do this dry-fit the front of the speeder and the back and see the hollow middle section.
	- We won't be using the middle door thing, nor the rear weapon mount plate that supports the rear shell a bit.
	- Its also easier here to glue the piece with the engines on, as it helps support the rear hull dry-fit for now.
- Now get your xps foam, and start measuring. A set of calipers helps here. The idea here is to make a solid piece of foam that is a rectangle with the corners cut off that matches the profile of the hull, but is slightly smaller so it sits inside the plastic bits.
- Cut, sand, and carve away until you get a good fit. 
- Now we are going to measure up and cut some plasticard to go over our foam, and form the new centre chassis. This is why we recessed the foam, so that the plasticard can go over the top and still slip underneath the front and rear hull bits.
- Use superglue, plastic cement will melt the foam to nothing.
	- At this point I found it easier to glue the front and rear hull bits in place, and use them to help hold the plasticard in place whilst the glue sets.
	- You want to aim to get the plasticard to go under the front and rear hull pieces a bit, to ensure no gaps.
- Don't forget a piece of plasticard to go behind the front seats!
- Glue your block in place, and once everything is dry, fill the gaps with putty and sand till smooth.

### The stasis crypt fancy bits
Now we are going to fit the stasis crypt bits from the dark talon to the speeder. This was also took a while, as there is alot of sanding involved...
- Start with the roof, it wants cutting down until it fits in our newly built plasticard & foam section, between the front & rear hull pieces. Dry fit only at this point
- Now as for the side pieces, cut off the tubes at the bottom, they will just overhang, and also the tubes on the rear side, they also don't fit well.
- Now notice that the side pieces are tapered... yep that fat side need sanding so that its flush with the thin side. Enjoy.
	- On the dark talon model the centre arch on the sides fits nicely into the arch on the roof. On the landspeeder this isn't the case as its wider.
	- The aim is to cut & fit the roof & sides such that these arches line up, and we will scuplt the rest of the connecting arch in with putty.
- Once your happy with the fit glue them down, there will be gaps everywhere (even underneath).
- Once set, fill the gaps with greenstuff.
- Connect the side arches to the centre arch using green stuff.
- Attach the bottom rails to the speeder as step 5 of the instructions
	- I messed up a little on the roof here, and cut it too short. You can see there is a cable attached to a skull on the roof piece, I should have left this longer. So I hid my mistake by cutting off some of the beams that are attached in step 5 to the roof, to make a cable divider thing.

### The rest of the f*cking owl
- attach the rest of the speeder bits, spoiler, air intake, wierd bottom counterweight thing, aerial etc.
- It was at this point I decided it looked like a shoebox. So I cut off the rear baby winglet things, and replaced them with the tail fins from the Valkyrie gunship. They're bigger, and give the whole speeder a nice profile. 
	- Rather than attach them directly to where the little baby wings were, I attached them at the top, so that they from a slope with the slanted edges of the speeder, where the aerial attaches.
- It is to the underside of these new big boy wings we will attach the rest of our guns.

### Sorry, but I ordered a large side of dakka?
We are putting more guns on this bad boy. Underslung from the new Valkyrie wings.
- If you put THBs in the nose you can easily just attach an Assault cannon under each wing and call it a day if you want.
- We use the Tyhoon missile pods from the ravenwing kit as the gun pods here. We use the rear, and two middle bits to form them. ( I thought about using the fatter front half also, but really couldn't be bothered trying to extract the missiles from it).
- Cut the attachment stand/beam things off, we don't need them.
- We can put either a heavy bolter, sideways in each, or 3 normal bolters, so together they make up a hurricane bolter.
- Heavy Bolter:
	- If going the heavy bolter option, the heavy bolters from the Nephilim actually fit better than those from the ravenwing kit. They're bigger, and already are cut off halfway back.
	- Stick those bade boys in the front section, attach the rear, then fill the gaps, and that bit where there is molded ammo going into the pod with greenstuff. Once dry sand flush.
-	Hurricane Bolter:
	-	take 6 bolters from the dark talon, and both hurricane bolter back plates.
	-	cut the plates such that each holds 3 bolters & that it fits the inner profile of the typhoon pod.
	-	This requires some *finessing*, and carving away of the middle section of the pod such that it fits slightly recessed.
	-	Glue together, fill & sand as required.
-	You can probably come up with a way of putting the assualt cannons in these pods instead, but I've not tried it.
-	Now to attach the pods to the wings.
	-	There are 2 pieces on the ravenwing upgrade sprue that I've got no idea what their intended use it. They're identical and are next to the assault cannon ammo boxes, and the flood lights. They look like they're for mounting the cannons/lights maybe? Well whatever, they're gonna be gun pod mounting brackets now.
	-	Sand them liberally until they're flat, and give you a your desired amount of gap between pods & wings. (In my case this was 0, as I mounted the pods with the angled bit towards the wings, rather than the flat edge.)

### Part of the ship, part of the crew.
Time to fit the pilot & co-pilot/professional sword swinger. I used Primaris bits, because the rest of my force is Primaris. Unlike the basic landspeeder kit, the storm doesn't come with the legs of the crew molded to the seats, which is both a blessing, and a hassle.
- Don't fit backpacks they won't fit.
- Cut off the backpack mounting pegs, they look weird. Sand their backs smooth if you like. I did.
- They're a little tall, and have scuplted asses, so a gentle a sanding gives them a nice flat bottom and drops their height a smidge to fit in the cockpit.
- One of them needs a powersword/heavenfall blade. I'd suggest the co-pilot, as he's doing nothing now he doesn't have a bolter in front of him. Choose your favorite DA themed sword and make it fit.
- The pilot needs to look like he's piloting, I used what I think was the gunner arms from a Rhino kit? They are a little small on a primaris, but the shoulder pads can hide that, so its not noticeable. If I had the parts maybe the gunner arms from a repulsor might work? Otherwise get creative with your bits box.
- The legs. Primaris legs are chonky, and it is a real struggle to get them in there. I gave these guys the Lt. Dan treatment. Their legs are cut off a couple of mm below the knee pad, which themselves had a chunk carved out of them  to fit beneath the control console. Also had to taper their stubs inwards abit to get an angle on them such that they came together at the hip. But don't glue the legs to one another.
- Dry fit them, when you're happy glue the legs to the seats and in my case there were some ugly gaps, so I had to sculpt them some prosthetic asses with greenstuff.
- I didn't glue the torsos in, to make painting easier.

### Decoration
- Add ravenwing insignia, purity seals, skulls, whatever, to taste.
- I made some power conduits using coiled copper wire, and attached it here and there, and to the gun pods.
	- I used the power cable plugs from some heavy plasma incinerators to hide the connection points.
	- To make the coiled wire you can use something called a wire coiling gizmo (google it), you can make one out of a paperclip.
	- I'm personally not too sure about the cables going to the pods and might remove them after I've painted it. We'll see.
